# Curriculum Connect Business Plan

## Overview

This repository contains the business plan for Curriculum Connect, a platform designed to help students within the California State University (CSU) system plan their courses and research professors. The plan outlines the mission, situational analysis, objectives, and marketing strategy for the platform. This project was completed as part of the coursework for the "Principles for Marketing" foundation course during my Masters in Information Systems degree in 2023.

## Project Description

Curriculum Connect aims to address the challenges students face in planning their classes by providing a one-stop shop for course information, professor reviews, and degree planning tools. The business plan details:

*   **Mission:** To eliminate guesswork and empower students to make informed decisions about their education.
*   **Situational Analysis:** An analysis of Curriculum Connect's internal strengths/weaknesses, external opportunities/threats, the current market situation, and competitive analysis.
*   **Objectives:** Business and marketing objectives, including brand awareness and student adoption goals.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** Target market definition, segmentation, and marketing mix (product, place, promotion, pricing).
